# postgres

Run a Postgres database as a github action - see file **output.txt** for the results of running the query in **load.txt**. Clone this repo and you can run your own queries.

```
Run sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
CREATE DATABASE
You are now connected to database "test" as user "postgres".
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
 name | address
